# Appendix A: Definitions

## Definition 1.1.1: Complex Numbers

  > A **_complex number_** can be defined as an ordered pair $(x, y)$ of real numbers that are to be interpreted as points on the **_complex plane_**.
  
## Definition 1.1.2: Complex Plane

  > The **_complex plane_** (also referred to as the **_z-plane_**) is a geometric representation of the **_complex numbers_** established by the **_real axis_** and the perpendicular **_imaginary axis_**. It may be thought of as a modified Cartesian plane, with the **_real part_** of a complex number represented by a displacement along the x-axis (**_real axis_**), and the **_imaginary part_** by a displacement along the y-axis (**_imaginary axis_**).

## Definition 1.1.3: Real Axis
  
  > When a real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$ is displayed as a point $(x, 0)$, the resulting point is projected on the x-axis, or the **_real axis_** of the **_complex plane_**.
  
## Definition 1.1.4: Imaginary Axis
  
  > Complex numbers of the form $(0, y)$ are called **_pure imaginary numbers_** when $y \neq 0$. The resulting point is projected on the y-axis or the **_imaginary axis_** of the **_complex plane_**.
  
## Definition 1.1.5: Real Part

  > The real number $x$ is known as the **_real part_** of $z$. This part may be written as $x = \Re{(z)}$
  
## Definition 1.1.6: Imaginary Part

  > The real number $y$ is known as the **_imaginary part_** of $z$. This part may be written as $y = \Im{(z)}$
